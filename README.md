## A random Quote generator is a web App that fetches rendom quotes or piece of advice from an api and displays the data using a fetch method 
The website is live at https://tanuj-kalonia.github.io/Random_Quote_generator/.

### This is implemented in react, so I am using a library that is AXIOS.
this lib provides many useful methods to fetch the data from the API.

example :
```
axios.get('API_LINK')
.then((response)=>{
     console.log(response)
}
.catch((error) => {
     console.log(error)
}
```
